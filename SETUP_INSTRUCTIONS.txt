ðŸš€ COMPLETE SETUP GUIDE - ALL FEATURES IMPLEMENTED!

QUICK SETUP - DO THESE 3 THINGS:

1. UPDATE FIRESTORE RULES (Firebase Console â†’ Firestore â†’ Rules):
   Copy-paste this:

rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {

    // Users collection (for auth system)
    match /users/{userId} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
      allow write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }

    // Applications collection (your original working rules)
    match /applications/{document=**} {
      // Authenticated users can do everything
      allow read, write, update, delete: if request.auth != null;
      
      // Unauthenticated users (guests) can create and read only
      allow create, read: if request.auth == null;
    }

    // Messages collection (for admin-to-student messaging)
    match /messages/{messageId} {
      allow read, update: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == resource.data.to;
      allow create: if request.auth != null;
    }

    // Default rule for all other collections
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
      allow read: if request.auth == null;
    }
  }
}

2. ADD CLOUDINARY TO .env.local:
   NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=dlvgrs5vp
   NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_PRESET=newslinetrainingagency

3. TEST THE SYSTEM:
   - Go to /auth/signup â†’ Create student & company accounts
   - Go to / â†’ Apply for attachment (CV upload works!)
   - Login as admin â†’ /admin/enhanced (assign students)
   - Login as admin â†’ /admin/content (add gallery & testimonials)
   - Test forgot password at /auth/forgot-password
